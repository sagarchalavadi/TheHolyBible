			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the Tent of Meeting, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">"Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When anyone of you offers an offering to Yahweh, you shall offer your offering of the cattle, of the herd and of the flock.</verse>
				<verse number="3">If his offering is a burnt offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish. He shall offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He shall kill the bull before Yahweh. Aaron's sons, the priests, shall present the blood and sprinkle the blood around on the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay wood in order on the fire;</verse>
				<verse number="8">and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar;</verse>
				<verse number="9">but its innards and its legs he shall wash with water. The priest shall burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="10">If his offering is of the flock, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before Yahweh. Aaron's sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat. The priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar,</verse>
				<verse number="13">but the innards and the legs he shall wash with water. The priest shall offer the whole, and burn it on the altar: it is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="14">If his offering to Yahweh is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall offer his offering of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar;</verse>
				<verse number="16">and he shall take away its crop with its filth, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes:</verse>
				<verse number="17">and he shall tear it by its wings, but shall not divide it apart. The priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.</verse>

			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">"'When anyone offers an offering of a meal-offering to Yahweh, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense on it.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests; and he shall take his handful of its fine flour, and of its oil, with all its frankincense; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it on the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="3">That which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons'. It is a most holy thing of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When you offer an offering of a meal-offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.</verse>
				<verse number="5">If your offering is a meal-offering of the baking-pan, it shall be of unleavened fine flour, mingled with oil.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You shall cut it in pieces, and pour oil on it. It is a meal-offering.</verse>
				<verse number="7">If your offering be a meal-offering of the frying-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You shall bring the meal-offering that is made of these things to Yahweh: and it shall be presented to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The priest shall take up from the meal-offering the memorial of it, and shall burn it on the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="10">That which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.</verse>
				<verse number="11">No meal-offering, which you shall offer to Yahweh, shall be made with yeast; for you shall burn no yeast, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As an offering of first -[fruits] you shall offer them to Yahweh: but they shall not come up for a sweet savor on the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Every offering of your meal-offering shall you season with salt; neither shall you allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your meal-offering: with all your offerings you shall offer salt.</verse>
				<verse number="14">If you offer a meal-offering of first-fruits to Yahweh, you shall offer for the meal-offering of your first-fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, bruised grain of the fresh ear.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You shall put oil on it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meal-offering.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the bruised grain of it, and part of the oil of it, with all the frankincense of it: it is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</verse>

			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">If his offering be a sacrifice of peace-offerings; if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before Yahweh.</verse>

				<verse number="3">He shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire to Yahweh; the fat that covers the inwards, and all the fat that is on the inwards,</verse>

				<verse number="7">If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before Yahweh;</verse>
				<verse number="8">and he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it before the tent of meeting: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood of it on the altar round about.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire to Yahweh; the fat of it, the fat tail entire, he shall take away hard by the backbone; and the fat that covers the inwards, and all the fat that is on the inwards,</verse>
				<verse number="10">and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The priest shall burn it on the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="12">If his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before Yahweh:</verse>
				<verse number="13">and he shall lay his hand on the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood of it on the altar round about.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He shall offer of it his offering, [even] an offering made by fire to Yahweh; the fat that covers the inwards, and all the fat that is on the inwards,</verse>
				<verse number="15">and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The priest shall burn them on the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savor; all the fat is Yahweh's.</verse>
				<verse number="17">It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that you shall eat neither fat nor blood.</verse>

			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If anyone shall sin unwittingly, in any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and shall do any one of them:</verse>
				<verse number="3">if the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bull without blemish to Yahweh for a sin-offering.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He shall bring the bull to the door of the tent of meeting before Yahweh; and he shall lay his hand on the head of the bull, and kill the bull before Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bull, and bring it to the tent of meeting:</verse>
				<verse number="6">and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before Yahweh, before the veil of the sanctuary.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The priest shall put of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bull shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.</verse>
				<verse number="8">All the fat of the bull of the sin-offering he shall take off from it; the fat that covers the inwards, and all the fat that is on the inwards,</verse>
				<verse number="9">and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away,</verse>
				<verse number="10">as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings: and the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The skin of the bull, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung,</verse>
				<verse number="12">even the whole bull shall he carry forth outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt.</verse>
				<verse number="13">If the whole congregation of Israel err, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and are guilty;</verse>
				<verse number="14">when the sin in which they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bull for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before Yahweh; and the bull shall be killed before Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bull to the tent of meeting:</verse>
				<verse number="17">and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before Yahweh, before the veil.</verse>

				<verse number="19">All the fat of it shall he take off from it, and burn it on the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Thus shall he do with the bull; as he did with the bull of the sin-offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.</verse>
				<verse number="21">He shall carry forth the bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bull: it is the sin-offering for the assembly.</verse>
				<verse number="22">When a ruler sins, and does unwittingly any one of all the things which Yahweh his God has commanded not to be done, and is guilty;</verse>
				<verse number="23">if his sin, in which he has sinned, be made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without blemish.</verse>
				<verse number="24">He shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before Yahweh: it is a sin-offering.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and the blood of it shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering.</verse>
				<verse number="26">All the fat of it shall he burn on the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin, and he shall be forgiven.</verse>
				<verse number="27">If anyone of the common people sin unwittingly, in doing any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and be guilty;</verse>
				<verse number="28">if his sin, which he has sinned, be made known to him, then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has sinned.</verse>
				<verse number="29">He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt offering.</verse>
				<verse number="30">The priest shall take of the blood of it with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and all the blood of it shall he pour out at the base of the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="31">All the fat of it shall he take away, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a sweet savor to Yahweh; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.</verse>
				<verse number="32">If he bring a lamb as his offering for a sin-offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.</verse>
				<verse number="33">He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.</verse>
				<verse number="34">The priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and all the blood of it shall he pour out at the base of the altar:</verse>
				<verse number="35">and all the fat of it shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, on the offerings of Yahweh made by fire; and the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he has sinned, and he shall be forgiven.</verse>

			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">If anyone sin, in that he hears the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he has seen or known, if he doesn't report it, then he shall bear his iniquity.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Or if anyone touch any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean animal, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and it be hidden from him, and he be unclean, then he shall be guilty.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatever his uncleanness be with which he is unclean, and it be hid from him; when he knows of it, then he shall be guilty.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Or if anyone swear rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatever it be that a man shall utter rashly with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knows of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these [things].</verse>
				<verse number="5">It shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these [things], that he shall confess that in which he has sinned:</verse>
				<verse number="6">and he shall bring his trespass-offering to Yahweh for his sin which he has sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin.</verse>
				<verse number="7">If his means aren't sufficient for a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass-offering for that in which he has sinned, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to Yahweh; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt offering.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide it apart:</verse>
				<verse number="9">and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering on the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin-offering.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he has sinned, and he shall be forgiven.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But if his means aren't sufficient for two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his offering for that in which he has sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering: he shall put no oil on it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon; for it is a sin-offering.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial of it, and burn it on the altar, on the offerings of Yahweh made by fire: it is a sin-offering.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he has sinned in any of these things, and he shall be forgiven: and [the remnant] shall be the priest's, as the meal-offering.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="15">If anyone commits a trespass, and sin unwittingly, in the holy things of Yahweh; then he shall bring his trespass-offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your estimation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering:</verse>
				<verse number="16">and he shall make restitution for that which he has done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and he shall be forgiven.</verse>
				<verse number="17">If anyone sins, and does any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done; though he didn't know it, yet he is guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your estimation, for a trespass-offering, to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the thing in which he erred unwittingly and didn't know it, and he shall be forgiven.</verse>
				<verse number="19">It is a trespass-offering: he is certainly guilty before Yahweh.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">If anyone sins, and commit a trespass against Yahweh, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of bargain, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor,</verse>
				<verse number="3">or have found that which was lost, and deal falsely therein, and swear to a lie; in any of all these things that a man does, sinning therein;</verse>
				<verse number="4">then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he has gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found,</verse>
				<verse number="5">or any thing about which he has sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more thereto: to him to whom it appertains shall he give it, in the day of his being found guilty.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He shall bring his trespass-offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your estimation, for a trespass-offering, to the priest:</verse>
				<verse number="7">and the priest shall make atonement for him before Yahweh; and he shall be forgiven concerning whatever he does so as to be guilty thereby.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="9">Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: the burnt offering shall be on the hearth on the altar all night to the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereon.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put on his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes whereto the fire has consumed the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes outside of the camp to a clean place.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The fire on the altar shall be kept burning thereon, it shall not go out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning: and he shall lay the burnt offering in order on it, and shall burn thereon the fat of the peace-offerings.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.</verse>
				<verse number="14">This is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before Yahweh, before the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He shall take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of the oil of it, and all the frankincense which is on the meal-offering, and shall burn it on the altar for a sweet savor, as the memorial of it, to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="16">That which is left of it shall Aaron and his sons eat: it shall be eaten without yeast in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.</verse>
				<verse number="17">It shall not be baked with yeast. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the trespass-offering.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as [his] portion for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of Yahweh made by fire: whoever touches them shall be holy.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="20">This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to Yahweh in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening.</verse>
				<verse number="21">On a baking-pan it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, you shall bring it in: in baked pieces shall you offer the meal-offering for a sweet savor to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The anointed priest that shall be in his place from among his sons shall offer it: by a statute for ever it shall be wholly burnt to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="25">Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before Yahweh: it is most holy.</verse>
				<verse number="26">The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it: in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Whatever shall touch the flesh of it shall be holy; and when there is sprinkled of the blood of it on any garment, you shall wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken; and if it be boiled in a brazen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Every male among the priests shall eat of it: it is most holy.</verse>
				<verse number="30">No sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt with fire.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">This is the law of the trespass-offering: it is most holy.</verse>
				<verse number="2">In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass-offering; and the blood of it shall he sprinkle on the altar round about.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He shall offer of it all the fat of it: the fat tail, and the fat that covers the inwards,</verse>
				<verse number="4">and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away;</verse>
				<verse number="5">and the priest shall burn them on the altar for an offering made by fire to Yahweh: it is a trespass-offering.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Every male among the priests shall eat of it: it shall be eaten in a holy place: it is most holy.</verse>
				<verse number="7">As is the sin-offering, so is the trespass-offering; there is one law for them: the priest who makes atonement therewith, he shall have it.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The priest who offers any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has offered.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Every meal-offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying-pan, and on the baking-pan, shall be the priest's who offers it.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another.</verse>
				<verse number="11">This is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which one shall offer to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="12">If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked.</verse>
				<verse number="13">With cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his offering with the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Of it he shall offer one out of each offering for a heave-offering to Yahweh; it shall be the priest's who sprinkles the blood of the peace-offerings.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a freewill-offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice; and on the next day that which remains of it shall be eaten:</verse>
				<verse number="17">but that which remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.</verse>
				<verse number="18">If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to him who offers it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. As for the flesh, everyone who is clean shall eat of it:</verse>
				<verse number="20">but the soul who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that pertain to Yahweh, having his uncleanness on him, that soul shall be cut off from his people.</verse>
				<verse number="21">When anyone shall touch any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean animal, or any unclean abomination, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which pertain to Yahweh, that soul shall be cut off from his people.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="23">Speak to the children of Israel, saying, You shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The fat of that which dies of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of animals, may be used for any other service; but you shall in no way eat of it.</verse>
				<verse number="25">For whoever eats the fat of the animal, of which men offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh, even the soul who eats it shall be cut off from his people.</verse>
				<verse number="26">You shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of bird or of animal, in any of your dwellings.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Whoever it be who eats any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="29">Speak to the children of Israel, saying, He who offers the sacrifice of his peace-offerings to Yahweh shall bring his offering to Yahweh out of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings:</verse>
				<verse number="30">his own hands shall bring the offerings of Yahweh made by fire; the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave-offering before Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="31">The priest shall burn the fat on the altar; but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.</verse>
				<verse number="32">The right thigh shall you give to the priest for a heave-offering out of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings.</verse>
				<verse number="33">He among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion.</verse>
				<verse number="34">For the wave-breast and the heave-thigh have I taken of the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as [their] portion forever from the children of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="35">This is the anointing-portion of Aaron, and the anointing-portion of his sons, out of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister to Yahweh in the priest's office;</verse>
				<verse number="36">which Yahweh commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them. It is [their] portion for ever throughout their generations.</verse>
				<verse number="37">This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the trespass-offering, and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace- offerings;</verse>
				<verse number="38">which Yahweh commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their offerings to Yahweh, in the wilderness of Sinai.</verse>

				<verse number="2">Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bull of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;</verse>
				<verse number="3">and assemble you all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Moses did as Yahweh commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Moses said to the congregation, This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded to be done.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.</verse>
				<verse number="7">He put on him the coat, and girded him with the sash, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him, and he girded him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and bound it to him therewith.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He placed the breastplate on him: and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He set the turban on his head; and on the turban, in front, did he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tent and all that was therein, and sanctified them.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He sprinkled of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the basin and its base, to sanctify them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He poured of the anointing oil on Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Moses brought Aaron's sons, and clothed them with coats, and girded them with girdles, and bound headbands on them; as Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He brought the bull of the sin-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin-offering.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He killed it; and Moses took the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He took all the fat that was on the inwards, and the cover of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses burned it on the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But the bull, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burnt with fire outside of the camp; as Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He presented the ram of the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.</verse>
				<verse number="19">He killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar round about.</verse>
				<verse number="20">He cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.</verse>
				<verse number="21">He washed the inwards and the legs with water; and Moses burnt the whole ram on the altar: it was a burnt offering for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire to Yahweh; as Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="22">He presented the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.</verse>
				<verse number="23">He killed it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.</verse>
				<verse number="24">He brought Aaron's sons; and Moses put of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot: and Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar round about.</verse>
				<verse number="25">He took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the inwards, and the cover of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh:</verse>
				<verse number="26">and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before Yahweh, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and on the right thigh:</verse>
				<verse number="27">and he put the whole on the hands of Aaron, and on the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave-offering before Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar on the burnt offering: they were a consecration for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave-offering before Yahweh: it was Moses' portion of the ram of consecration; as Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting: and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.</verse>
				<verse number="32">That which remains of the flesh and of the bread shall you burn with fire.</verse>
				<verse number="33">You shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days.</verse>
				<verse number="34">As has been done this day, so Yahweh has commanded to do, to make atonement for you.</verse>
				<verse number="35">At the door of the tent of meeting shall you abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of Yahweh, that you don't die: for so I am commanded.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Aaron and his sons did all the things which Yahweh commanded by Moses.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">It happened on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;</verse>
				<verse number="2">and he said to Aaron, Take a calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="3">To the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, Take a male goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt offering;</verse>
				<verse number="4">and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh; and a meal-offering mingled with oil: for today Yahweh appears to you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Moses said, This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you should do: and the glory of Yahweh shall appear to you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Moses said to Aaron, Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin-offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as Yahweh commanded.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So Aaron drew near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:</verse>
				<verse number="10">but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt on the altar; as Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The flesh and the skin he burnt with fire outside of the camp.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, and he sprinkled it on the altar round about.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They delivered the burnt- offering to him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burnt them on the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He washed the inwards and the legs, and burnt them on the burnt offering on the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He presented the people's offering, and took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, as the first.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He presented the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He presented the meal-offering, and filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He killed also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled on the altar round about,</verse>
				<verse number="19">and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers [the inwards], and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver:</verse>
				<verse number="20">and they put the fat on the breasts, and he burnt the fat on the altar:</verse>
				<verse number="21">and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before Yahweh; as Moses commanded.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace-offerings.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the people.</verse>
				<verse number="24">There came forth fire from before Yahweh, and consumed on the altar the burnt offering and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before Yahweh, which he had not commanded them.</verse>
				<verse number="2">There came forth fire from before Yahweh, and devoured them, and they died before Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Moses said to Aaron, This is it what Yahweh spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in those who come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified. Aaron held his peace.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Draw near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Don't let the hair of your heads go loose, neither tear your clothes; that you don't die, and that he not be angry with all the congregation: but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Yahweh has kindled.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of Yahweh is on you. They did according to the word of Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh spoke to Aaron, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="9">Drink no wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, that you don't die: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations:</verse>
				<verse number="10">and that you may make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;</verse>
				<verse number="11">and that you may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Yahweh has spoken to them by Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, Take the meal-offering that remains of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, and eat it without yeast beside the altar; for it is most holy;</verse>
				<verse number="13">and you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion, and your sons' portion, of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire: for so I am commanded.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The wave-breast and the heave-thigh shall you eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they are given as your portion, and your sons' portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The heave-thigh and the wave-breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before Yahweh: and it shall be your, and your sons' with you, as a portion forever; as Yahweh has commanded.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="17">Why haven't you eaten the sin-offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Yahweh?</verse>
				<verse number="18">Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within: you should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Aaron spoke to Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin- offering and their burnt offering before Yahweh; and there have befallen me such things as these: and if I had eaten the sin-offering today, would it have been well-pleasing in the sight of Yahweh?</verse>
				<verse number="20">When Moses heard [that], it was well-pleasing in his sight.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,</verse>
				<verse number="2">Speak to the children of Israel, saying, These are the living things which you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Whatever parts the hoof, and is cloven-footed, [and] chews the cud, among the animals, that may you eat.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Nevertheless these shall you not eat of them that chew the cud, or of those who part the hoof: the camel, because he chews the cud but doesn't have a parted hoof, he is unclean to you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The rabbit, because he chews the cud but doesn't have a parted the hoof, he is unclean to you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The hare, because she chews the cud but doesn't part the hoof, she is unclean to you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The pig, because he doesn't part the hoof, and is cloven-footed, but doesn't chew the cud, he is unclean to you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch; they are unclean to you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">These may you eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that may you eat.</verse>
				<verse number="10">All that don't have fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination to you,</verse>
				<verse number="11">and they shall be an abomination to you; you shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses you shall have in abomination.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Whatever has no fins nor scales in the waters, that is an abomination to you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">These you shall have in abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the ospray,</verse>
				<verse number="14">and the kite, and the falcon after its kind,</verse>
				<verse number="15">every raven after its kind,</verse>
				<verse number="16">and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the seamew, and the hawk after its kind,</verse>
				<verse number="17">and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,</verse>
				<verse number="18">and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture,</verse>
				<verse number="19">and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.</verse>
				<verse number="20">All winged creeping things that go on all fours are an abomination to you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Yet these may you eat of all winged creeping things that go on all fours, which have legs above their feet, with which to leap on the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Even these of them you may eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But all winged creeping things, which have four feet, are an abomination to you.</verse>
				<verse number="24">By these you shall become unclean: whoever touches the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even;</verse>
				<verse number="25">Whoever bears [anything] of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Every animal which parts the hoof, and is not cloven-footed, nor chews the cud, is unclean to you: everyone who touches them shall be unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Whatever goes on its paws, among all animals that go on all fours, they are unclean to you: whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the even.</verse>
				<verse number="28">He who bears the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean to you.</verse>
				<verse number="29">These are they which are unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind,</verse>
				<verse number="30">and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon.</verse>
				<verse number="31">These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep: whoever does touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even.</verse>
				<verse number="32">On whatever any of them, when they are dead, does fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or clothing, or skin, or sack, whatever vessel it be, with which any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Every earthen vessel, into which any of them falls, whatever is in it shall be unclean, and it you shall break.</verse>
				<verse number="34">All food [therein] which may be eaten, that on which water comes, shall be unclean; and all drink that may be drunk in every [such] vessel shall be unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Every thing whereupon [any part] of their carcass falls shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces: they are unclean, and shall be unclean to you.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Nevertheless a spring or a pit in which is a gathering of water shall be clean: but that which touches their carcass shall be unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="37">If [anything] of their carcass fall on any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean.</verse>
				<verse number="38">But if water be put on the seed, and [anything] of their carcass fall thereon, it is unclean to you.</verse>
				<verse number="39">If any animal, of which you may eat, die; he who touches the carcass of it shall be unclean until the even.</verse>
				<verse number="40">He who eats of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that bears the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Every creeping thing that creeps on the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Whatever goes on the belly, and whatever goes on all fours, or whatever has many feet, even all creeping things that creep on the earth, them you shall not eat; for they are an abomination.</verse>
				<verse number="43">You shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creeps, neither shall you make yourselves unclean with them, that you should be defiled thereby.</verse>
				<verse number="44">For I am Yahweh your God: sanctify yourselves therefore, and be you holy; for I am holy: neither shall you defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that moves on the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="45">For I am Yahweh who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: you shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.</verse>
				<verse number="46">This is the law of the animal, and of the bird, and of every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that creeps on the earth;</verse>
				<verse number="47">to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a woman conceive seed, and bear a man-child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="3">In the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.</verse>
				<verse number="4">She shall continue in the blood of [her] purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But if she bear a maid-child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her impurity; and she shall continue in the blood of [her] purifying sixty-six days.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb a year old for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, to the door of the tent of meeting, to the priest:</verse>
				<verse number="7">and he shall offer it before Yahweh, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her who bears, whether a male or a female.</verse>
				<verse number="8">If her means isn't sufficient for a lamb, then she shall take two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons; the one for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin-offering: and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests:</verse>
				<verse number="3">and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and if the hair in the plague be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="4">If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance of it isn't deeper than the skin, and the hair of it isn't turned white, then the priest shall shut up [him who has] the plague seven days:</verse>
				<verse number="5">and the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if in his eyes the plague be at a stay, and the plague isn't spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:</verse>
				<verse number="6">and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague be dim, and the plague hasn't spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But if the scab spread abroad in the skin, after that he has showed himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again:</verse>
				<verse number="8">and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the scab be spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.</verse>
				<verse number="9">When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest;</verse>
				<verse number="10">and the priest shall look; and, behold, if there be a white rising in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising,</verse>
				<verse number="11">it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="12">If the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of [him who has] the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as appears to the priest;</verse>
				<verse number="13">then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce [him] clean [who has] the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But whenever raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed to white, then he shall come to the priest;</verse>
				<verse number="17">and the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the plague be turned into white, then the priest shall pronounce [him] clean [who has] the plague: he is clean.</verse>
				<verse number="18">When the flesh has in the skin of it a boil, and it is healed,</verse>
				<verse number="19">and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then is shall be showed to the priest;</verse>
				<verse number="20">and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the appearance of it be lower than the skin, and the hair of it be turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy, it has broken out in the boil.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and it isn't lower than the skin, but is dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:</verse>
				<verse number="22">If it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But if the bright spot stay in its place, and hasn't spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Or when the flesh has in the skin of it a burning by fire, and the quick [flesh] of the burning become a bright spot, reddish-white, or white;</verse>
				<verse number="25">then the priest shall look on it; and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and the appearance of it be deeper than the skin; it is leprosy, it has broken out in the burning: and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:</verse>
				<verse number="27">and the priest shall look on him the seventh day: if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.</verse>
				<verse number="28">If the bright spot stays in its place, and hasn't spread in the skin, but be dim; it is the rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is the scar of the burning.</verse>
				<verse number="29">When a man or woman has a plague on the head or on the beard,</verse>
				<verse number="30">then the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the appearance of it be deeper than the skin, and there be in it yellow thin hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scall, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.</verse>
				<verse number="31">If the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, the appearance of it isn't deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up [him who has] the plague of the scall seven days:</verse>
				<verse number="32">In the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the scall isn't spread, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall isn't deeper than the skin,</verse>
				<verse number="33">then he shall be shaved, but he shall not shave the scall; and the priest shall shut up [him who has] the scall seven days more:</verse>
				<verse number="34">and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall; and, behold, if the scall hasn't spread in the skin, and the appearance of it isn't deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</verse>
				<verse number="35">But if the scall spread abroad in the skin after his cleansing,</verse>
				<verse number="36">then the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="37">But if in his eyes the scall be at a stay, and black hair be grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</verse>
				<verse number="38">When a man or a woman has in the skin of the flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;</verse>
				<verse number="39">then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be of a dull white, it is a harmless rash, it has broken out in the skin; he is clean.</verse>
				<verse number="40">If a man's hair be fallen off his head, he is bald; [yet] is he clean.</verse>
				<verse number="41">If his hair be fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead bald; [yet] is he clean.</verse>
				<verse number="42">But if there be in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Then the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the rising of the plague be reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh;</verse>
				<verse number="44">he is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his plague is in his head.</verse>
				<verse number="45">The leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be torn, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.</verse>

				<verse number="23">You shall not lie with any animal to defile yourself therewith; neither shall any woman stand before a animal, to lie down thereto: it is confusion.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Don't defile yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out from before you;</verse>
				<verse number="25">The land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity of it on it, and the land vomits out her inhabitants.</verse>
				<verse number="26">You therefore shall keep my statutes and my ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the home-born, nor the stranger who sojourns among you;</verse>
				<verse number="27">(for all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you, and the land is defiled);</verse>
				<verse number="28">that the land not vomit you out also, when you defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For whoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Therefore shall you keep my charge, that you not practice any of these abominable customs, which were practiced before you, and that you not defile yourselves therein: I am Yahweh your God.</verse>

				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel, and tell them, You shall be holy; for I Yahweh your God am holy.</verse>
				<verse number="3">You shall fear every man his mother, and his father; and you shall keep my Sabbaths: I am Yahweh your God.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Don't turn to idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am Yahweh your God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When you offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Yahweh, you shall offer it that you may be accepted.</verse>
				<verse number="6">It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and on the next day: and if anything remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire.</verse>
				<verse number="7">If it be eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it shall not be accepted:</verse>
				<verse number="8">but everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy thing of Yahweh: and that soul shall be cut off from his people.</verse>
				<verse number="9">When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleaning of your harvest.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You shall not glean your vineyard, neither shall you gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am Yahweh your God.</verse>

				<verse number="12">You shall not swear by my name falsely, and profane the name of your God: I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="13">You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him: the wages of a hired servant shall not remain with you all night until the morning.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind; but you shall fear your God: I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: you shall not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty; but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor.</verse>
				<verse number="16">You shall not go up and down as a talebearer among your people: neither shall you stand against the blood of your neighbor: I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="17">You shall not hate your brother in your heart: you shall surely rebuke your neighbor, and not bear sin because of him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people; but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your cattle breed with a diverse kind: you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed: neither shall there come on you a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Whoever lies carnally with a woman, who is a bondmaid, pledged to be married to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; they shall be punished; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.</verse>
				<verse number="21">He shall bring his trespass-offering to Yahweh, to the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a trespass-offering.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before Yahweh for his sin which he has sinned: and the sin which he has sinned shall be forgiven him.</verse>
				<verse number="23">When you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit of it as their uncircumcision: three years shall they be as uncircumcised to you; it shall not be eaten.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But in the fourth year all the fruit of it shall be holy, for giving praise to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="25">In the fifth year shall you eat of the fruit of it, that it may yield to you the increase of it: I am Yahweh your God.</verse>
				<verse number="26">You shall not eat anything with the blood: neither shall you use enchantments, nor practice sorcery.</verse>
				<verse number="27">You shall not cut the hair on the sides of your heads, neither shall you clip off the edge of your beard.</verse>
				<verse number="28">You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks on you: I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Don't profane your daughter, to make her a prostitute; lest the land fall to prostitution, and the land become full of wickedness.</verse>
				<verse number="30">You shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary; I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Don't turn to those who have familiar spirits, nor to the wizards; don't seek them out, to be defiled by them: I am Yahweh your God.</verse>
				<verse number="32">You shall rise up before the gray head, and honor the face of the old man, and you shall fear your God: I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="33">If a stranger sojourn with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong.</verse>
				<verse number="34">The stranger who sojourns with you shall be to you as the home-born among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt: I am Yahweh your God.</verse>
				<verse number="35">You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of length, of weight, or of quantity.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall you have: I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.</verse>

			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>

				<verse number="3">I also will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he has given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.</verse>
				<verse number="4">If the people at the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he gives of his seed to Molech, and don't put him to death;</verse>
				<verse number="5">then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all who play the prostitute after him, to play the prostitute with Molech, from among their people.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The soul that turns to those who have familiar spirits, and to the wizards, to play the prostitute after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be you holy; for I am Yahweh your God.</verse>

				<verse number="13">If a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be on them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">If a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">If a man lie with a animal, he shall surely be put to death: and you shall kill the animal.</verse>
				<verse number="16">If a woman approach to any animal, and lie down thereto, you shall kill the woman, and the animal: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be on them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">If a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a shameful thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people: he has uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.</verse>
				<verse number="18">If a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he has made naked her fountain, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister, nor of your father's sister; for he has made naked his close relative: they shall bear their iniquity.</verse>

				<verse number="23">You shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But I have said to you, You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey: I am Yahweh your God, who has separated you from the peoples.</verse>
				<verse number="25">You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean: and you shall not make your souls abominable by animal, or by bird, or by anything with which the ground teems, which I have separated from you as unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="26">You shall be holy to me: for I, Yahweh, am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that you should be mine.</verse>
				<verse number="27">A man also or a woman that has a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones; their blood shall be on them.</verse>

			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh said to Moses, Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them, There shall none defile himself for the dead among his people;</verse>
				<verse number="2">except for his relatives, that is near to him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,</verse>
				<verse number="3">and for his sister a virgin, that is near to him, that has had no husband; for her may he defile himself.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He shall not defile himself, [being] a chief man among his people, to profane himself.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They shall not make baldness on their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God; for the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They shall not take a woman that is a prostitute, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy to his God.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You shall sanctify him therefore; for he offers the bread of your God: he shall be holy to you: for I Yahweh, who sanctify you, am holy.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the prostitute, she profanes her father: she shall be burnt with fire.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He who is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor tear his clothes;</verse>
				<verse number="11">neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;</verse>
				<verse number="12">neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is on him: I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He shall take a wife in her virginity.</verse>
				<verse number="14">A widow, or one divorced, or a profane woman, a prostitute, these shall he not take: but a virgin of his own people shall he take as a wife.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He shall not profane his seed among his people: for I am Yahweh who sanctifies him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="17">Speak to Aaron, saying, Whoever he be of your seed throughout their generations that has a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For whatever man he be that has a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that has a flat nose, or any deformity,</verse>
				<verse number="19">or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed,</verse>
				<verse number="20">or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or that has a blemish in his eye, or is scurvy, or scabbed, or has his stones broken;</verse>
				<verse number="21">no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that has a blemish, shall come near to offer the offerings of Yahweh made by fire: he has a blemish; he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.</verse>
				<verse number="22">He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy:</verse>
				<verse number="23">only he shall not go in to the veil, nor come near to the altar, because he has a blemish; that he not profane my sanctuaries: for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="22">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they make holy to me, and that they not profane my holy name: I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Tell them, Whoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approaches to the holy things, which the children of Israel make holy to Yahweh, having his uncleanness on him, that soul shall be cut off from before me: I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Whatever man of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or has an issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he is clean. Whoever touches anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goes from him;</verse>
				<verse number="5">or whoever touches any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatever uncleanness he has;</verse>
				<verse number="6">the soul that touches any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.</verse>
				<verse number="8">That which dies of itself, or is torn by animals, he shall not eat, to defile himself therewith: I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.</verse>
				<verse number="10">There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest's, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.</verse>
				<verse number="12">If a priest's daughter be married to a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But if a priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and be returned to her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's bread: but there shall no stranger eat of it.</verse>
				<verse number="14">If a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part of it to it, and shall give to the priest the holy thing.</verse>
				<verse number="15">They shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer to Yahweh,</verse>
				<verse number="16">and [so] cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="18">Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and tell them, Whoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, that offers his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill-offerings, which they offer to Yahweh for a burnt offering;</verse>
				<verse number="19">that you may be accepted, [you shall offer] a male without blemish, of the bulls, of the sheep, or of the goats.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But whatever has a blemish, that shall you not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Whoever offers a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Yahweh to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, you shall not offer these to Yahweh, nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Either a bull or a lamb that has any deformity or lacking in his parts, that may you offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.</verse>
				<verse number="24">That which has its stones bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, you shall not offer to Yahweh; neither shall you do [thus] in your land.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall you offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them: they shall not be accepted for you.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="27">When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the hen; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the offering of an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Whether it be cow or ewe, you shall not kill it and its young both in one day.</verse>
				<verse number="29">When you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Yahweh, you shall sacrifice it that you may be accepted.</verse>
				<verse number="30">On the same day it shall be eaten; you shall leave none of it until the morning: I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Therefore shall you keep my commandments, and do them: I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="32">You shall not profane my holy name; but I will be made holy among the children of Israel: I am Yahweh who makes you holy,</verse>
				<verse number="33">who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Yahweh.</verse>

				<verse number="15">You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He who blasphemes the name of Yahweh, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemes the name [of Yahweh], shall be put to death.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He who strikes a animal mortally shall make it good, life for life.</verse>
				<verse number="19">If a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him:</verse>
				<verse number="20">breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered to him.</verse>
				<verse number="21">He who kills a animal shall make it good: and he who kills a man shall be put to death.</verse>
				<verse number="22">You shall have one manner of law, as well for the sojourner, as for the home-born: for I am Yahweh your God.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they brought forth him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. The children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>

			<chapter number="25">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses in Mount Sinai, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a Sabbath to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and gather in the fruits of it;</verse>
				<verse number="4">but in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a Sabbath to Yahweh: you shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard.</verse>
				<verse number="5">That which grows of itself of your harvest you shall not reap, and the grapes of your undressed vine you shall not gather: it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for you, and for your servant and for your maid, and for your hired servant and for your stranger, who sojourn with you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For your cattle, and for the animals that are in your land, shall all the increase of it be for food.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You shall number seven Sabbaths of years to you, seven times seven years; and there shall be to you the days of seven Sabbaths of years, even forty-nine years.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then shall you send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall you send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You shall make the fiftieth year holy, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants of it: it shall be a jubilee to you; and you shall return every man to his possession, and you shall return every man to his family.</verse>
				<verse number="11">A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be to you: you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it, nor gather [the grapes] in it of the undressed vines.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you: you shall eat the increase of it out of the field.</verse>
				<verse number="13">In this year of jubilee you shall return every man to his possession.</verse>
				<verse number="14">If you sell anything to your neighbor, or buy of your neighbor's hand, you shall not wrong one another.</verse>
				<verse number="15">According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall buy of your neighbor, [and] according to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you.</verse>
				<verse number="16">According to the length of the years you shall increase the price of it, and according to the shortness of the years you shall diminish the price of it; for the number of the crops does he sell to you.</verse>
				<verse number="17">You shall not wrong one another; but you shall fear your God: for I am Yahweh your God.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Therefore you shall do my statutes, and keep my ordinances and do them; and you shall dwell in the land in safety.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The land shall yield its fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.</verse>
				<verse number="20">If you shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;</verse>
				<verse number="21">then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.</verse>
				<verse number="22">You shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, you shall eat the old store.</verse>
				<verse number="23">The land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for you are strangers and sojourners with me.</verse>
				<verse number="24">In all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land.</verse>
				<verse number="25">If your brother be grew poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman who is next to him come, and shall redeem that which his brother has sold.</verse>
				<verse number="26">If a man have no one to redeem it, and he be grew rich and find sufficient to redeem it;</verse>
				<verse number="27">then let him reckon the years of the sale of it, and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return to his possession.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But if he isn't able to get it back for himself, then that which he has sold shall remain in the hand of him who has bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.</verse>
				<verse number="29">If a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year shall he have the right of redemption.</verse>
				<verse number="30">If it isn't redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee.</verse>
				<verse number="31">But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.</verse>
				<verse number="33">If one of the Levites redeem, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="34">But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.</verse>
				<verse number="35">If your brother has grown poor, and his hand fail with you; then you shall uphold him: [as] a stranger and a sojourner shall he live with you.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Take no interest of him or increase, but fear your God; that your brother may live with you.</verse>
				<verse number="37">You shall not give him your money on interest, nor give him your victuals for increase.</verse>
				<verse number="38">I am Yahweh your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, [and] to be your God.</verse>
				<verse number="39">If your brother has grown poor with you, and sell himself to you; you shall not make him to serve as a bond-servant.</verse>
				<verse number="40">As a hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with you; he shall serve with you to the year of jubilee:</verse>
				<verse number="41">then shall he go out from you, he and his children with him, and shall return to his own family, and to the possession of his fathers shall he return.</verse>
				<verse number="42">For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondservants.</verse>
				<verse number="43">You shall not rule over him with rigor, but shall fear your God.</verse>
				<verse number="44">As for your bondservants, and your bondmaids, whom you shall have; of the nations that are round about you, of them shall you buy bondservants and bondmaids.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Moreover of the children of the strangers who sojourn among you, of them shall you buy, and of their families who are with you, which they have conceived in your land: and they shall be your possession.</verse>
				<verse number="46">You shall make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them shall you take your bondservants forever: but over your brothers the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with rigor.</verse>
				<verse number="47">If a stranger or sojourner with you has grown rich, and your brother has grown poor beside him, and sell himself to the stranger [or] sojourner with you, or to the stock of the stranger's family;</verse>
				<verse number="48">after that he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brothers may redeem him;</verse>
				<verse number="49">or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any who is a close relative to him of his family may redeem him; or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself.</verse>
				<verse number="50">He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him.</verse>
				<verse number="51">If there be yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.</verse>
				<verse number="52">If there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years shall he give back the price of his redemption.</verse>
				<verse number="53">As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigor over him in your sight.</verse>
				<verse number="54">If he isn't redeemed by these [means], then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him.</verse>
				<verse number="55">For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Yahweh your God.</verse>

			<chapter number="26">
				<verse number="1">You shall make you no idols, neither shall you rear you up an engraved image, or a pillar, neither shall you place any figured stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am Yahweh your God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">You shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="3">If you walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;</verse>
				<verse number="4">then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time; and you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil animals to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I will have respect to you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall bring forth the old because of the new.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I will set my tent among you: and my soul won't abhor you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you shall be my people.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I am Yahweh your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their bondservants; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But if you will not listen to me, and will not do all these commandments;</verse>
				<verse number="15">and if you shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor my ordinances, so that you will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;</verse>
				<verse number="16">I also will do this to you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I will set my face against you, and you shall be struck before your enemies: those who hate you shall rule over you; and you shall flee when none pursues you.</verse>
				<verse number="18">If you will not yet for these things listen to me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your sky as iron, and your earth as brass;</verse>
				<verse number="20">and your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="21">If you walk contrary to me, and won't listen to me, I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I will send the animal of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.</verse>
				<verse number="23">If by these things you won't be reformed to me, but will walk contrary to me;</verse>
				<verse number="24">then will I also walk contrary to you; and I will strike you, even I, seven times for your sins.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I will bring a sword on you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and you shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</verse>
				<verse number="26">When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.</verse>
				<verse number="27">If you won't for all this listen to me, but walk contrary to me;</verse>
				<verse number="28">then I will walk contrary to you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.</verse>
				<verse number="29">You shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall you eat.</verse>
				<verse number="30">I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies on the bodies of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.</verse>
				<verse number="31">I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I won't smell the savor of your sweet odors.</verse>
				<verse number="32">I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it.</verse>
				<verse number="33">You will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then shall the land enjoy its Sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you are in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its Sabbaths.</verse>
				<verse number="35">As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it didn't have in your Sabbaths, when you lived on it.</verse>
				<verse number="36">As for those who are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursues.</verse>
				<verse number="37">They shall stumble one on another, as it were before the sword, when none pursues: and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="38">You shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Those who are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</verse>
				<verse number="40">They shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary to me,</verse>
				<verse number="41">I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;</verse>
				<verse number="42">then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</verse>
				<verse number="43">The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its Sabbaths, while it lies desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God;</verse>
				<verse number="45">but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="46">These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Yahweh made between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="27">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When a man shall accomplish a vow, the persons shall be for Yahweh by your estimation.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Your estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</verse>
				<verse number="4">If it be a female, then your estimation shall be thirty shekels.</verse>
				<verse number="5">If it be from five years old even to twenty years old, then your estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
				<verse number="6">If it be from a month old even to five years old, then your estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female your estimation shall be three shekels of silver.</verse>
				<verse number="7">If it be from sixty years old and upward; if it be a male, then your estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But if he be poorer than your estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him.</verse>
				<verse number="9">If it be a animal, whereof men offer an offering to Yahweh, all that any man gives of such to Yahweh shall be holy.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.</verse>
				<verse number="11">If it be any unclean animal, of which they do not offer an offering to Yahweh, then he shall set the animal before the priest;</verse>
				<verse number="12">and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as you the priest value it, so shall it be.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to your estimation.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to Yahweh, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.</verse>
				<verse number="15">If he who sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be his.</verse>
				<verse number="16">If a man shall sanctify to Yahweh part of the field of his possession, then your estimation shall be according to the sowing of it: the sowing of a homer of barley [shall be valued] at fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
				<verse number="17">If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to your estimation it shall stand.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the year of jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from your estimation.</verse>
				<verse number="19">If he who sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be assured to him.</verse>
				<verse number="20">If he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more:</verse>
				<verse number="21">but the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to Yahweh, as a field devoted; the possession of it shall be the priest's.</verse>
				<verse number="22">If he sanctify to Yahweh a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession;</verse>
				<verse number="23">then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your estimation to the year of jubilee: and he shall give your estimation in that day, as a holy thing to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="24">In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs.</verse>
				<verse number="25">All your estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Only the firstborn among animals, which is made a firstborn to Yahweh, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is Yahweh's.</verse>
				<verse number="27">If it be of an unclean animal, then he shall ransom it according to your estimation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it: or if it isn't redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your estimation.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to Yahweh of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="29">No one devoted, who shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.</verse>
				<verse number="30">All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is Yahweh's: it is holy to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="31">If a man will redeem anything of his tithe, he shall add to it the fifth part of it.</verse>
				<verse number="32">All the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="33">He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</verse>
				<verse number="34">These are the commandments, which Yahweh commanded Moses for the children of Israel in Mount Sinai.</verse>

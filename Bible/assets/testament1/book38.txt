			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Yahweh to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh was sore displeased with your fathers.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Therefore say you to them, Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: Return to me, says Yahweh of Hosts, and I will return to you, says Yahweh of Hosts.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Don't you be as your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried, saying, Thus says Yahweh of hosts, Return you now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor listen to me, says Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live forever?</verse>
				<verse number="6">But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? and they turned and said, Like as Yahweh of Hosts thought to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so has he dealt with us.</verse>
				<verse number="7">On the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Yahweh to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="8">I saw in the night, and, behold, a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then said I, my lord, what are these? The angel who talked with me said to me, I will show you what these are.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The man who stood among the myrtle-trees answered, These are they whom Yahweh has sent to walk back and forth through the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They answered the angel of Yahweh who stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked back and forth through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still, and is at rest.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then the angel of Yahweh answered, O Yahweh of Hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these seventy years?</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh answered the angel who talked with me with good words, [even] comfortable words.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So the angel who talked with me said to me, Cry you, saying, Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Therefore thus says Yahweh: I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it, says Yahweh of Hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Cry yet again, saying, Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity; and Yahweh shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I said to the angel who talked with me, What are these? He answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yahweh showed me four smiths.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then said I, What come these to do? He spoke, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head; but these are come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then said I, Where go you? He said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth of it, and what is the length of it.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Behold, the angel who talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</verse>
				<verse number="4">and said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For I, says Yahweh, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, says Yahweh; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky, says Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Ho Zion, escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For thus says Yahweh of hosts: After glory has he sent me to the nations which plundered you; for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those who served them; and you shall know that Yahweh of Hosts has sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion; for, behold, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of you, says Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Many nations shall join themselves to Yahweh in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of you, and you shall know that Yahweh of Hosts has sent me to you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yahweh shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Be silent, all flesh, before Yahweh; for he is waked up out of his holy habitation.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Yahweh, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh said to Satan, Yahweh rebuke you, Satan; yes, Yahweh that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</verse>
				<verse number="3">Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. To him he said, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I said, Let them set a clean mitre on his head. So they set a clean mitre on his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of Yahweh was standing by.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The angel of Yahweh protested to Joshua, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="7">Thus says Yahweh of hosts: If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my charge, then you also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among these who stand by.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you; for they are men who are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the engraving of it, says Yahweh of Hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</verse>
				<verse number="10">In that day, says Yahweh of hosts, shall you invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig-tree.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">The angel who talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man who is wakened out of his sleep.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He said to me, What see you? I said, I have seen, and, behold, a lampstand all of gold, with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on the top of it;</verse>
				<verse number="3">and two olive-trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side of it.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then the angel who talked with me answered me, Don't you know what these are? I said, No, my lord.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of Yahweh to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says Yahweh of Hosts.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Who are you, great mountain? before Zerubbabel [you shall become] a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shouts of Grace, grace, to it.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="9">The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and you shall know that Yahweh of Hosts has sent me to you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For who has despised the day of small things? for these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel; [these are] the eyes of Yahweh, which run back and forth through the whole earth.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then answered I, and said to him, What are these two olive-trees on the right side of the lampstand and on the left side of it?</verse>
				<verse number="12">I answered the second time, and said to him, What are these two olive-branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that empty the golden [oil] out of themselves?</verse>
				<verse number="13">He answered me and said, "Don't you know what these are?" I said, No, my lord.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Then again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, a flying scroll.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He said to me, What see you? I answered, I see a flying scroll; the length of it is twenty cubits, and the breadth of it ten cubits.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then said he to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the surface of the whole land: for everyone who steals shall be cut off on the one side according to it; and everyone who swears shall be cut off on the other side according to it.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I will cause it to go forth, says Yahweh of Hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears falsely by my name; and it shall abide in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber of it and the stones of it.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then the angel who talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now your eyes, and see what is this that goes forth.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I said, What is it? He said, This is the ephah that goes forth. He said moreover, This is their appearance in all the land</verse>
				<verse number="7">(and, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead); and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He said, This is Wickedness: and he cast her down into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead on the mouth of it.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then lifted I up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings; now they had wings like the wings of a stork; and they lifted up the ephah between earth and the sky.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then said I to the angel who talked with me, Where do these bear the ephah?</verse>
				<verse number="11">He said to me, To build her a house in the land of Shinar: and when it is prepared, she shall be set there in her own place.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.</verse>
				<verse number="2">In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</verse>
				<verse number="3">and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then I answered the angel who talked with me, What are these, my lord?</verse>
				<verse number="5">The angel answered me, These are the four winds of the sky, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="6">[The chariot] in which are the black horses goes forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The strong went forth, and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk back and forth through the earth. So they walked back and forth through the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then cried he to me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="10">Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come you the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they are come from Babylon;</verse>
				<verse number="11">yes, take [of them] silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;</verse>
				<verse number="12">and speak to him, saying, Thus speaks Yahweh of Hosts, saying, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build the temple of Yahweh;</verse>
				<verse number="13">even he shall build the temple of Yahweh; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne; and he shall be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Those who are far off shall come and build in the temple of Yahweh; and you shall know that Yahweh of hosts has sent me to you. [This] shall happen, if you will diligently obey the voice of Yahweh your God.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">It happened in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah in the fourth [day] of the ninth month, even in Chislev.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now [they of] Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to entreat the favor of Yahweh,</verse>
				<verse number="3">[and] to speak to the priests of the house of Yahweh of Hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then came the word of Yahweh of Hosts to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="5">Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh [month], even these seventy years, did you at all fast to me, even to me?</verse>
				<verse number="6">When you eat, and when you drink, do not you eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?</verse>
				<verse number="7">[Should you] not [hear] the words which Yahweh cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities of it round about her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?</verse>
				<verse number="8">The word of Yahweh came to Zechariah, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="9">Thus has Yahweh of Hosts spoken, saying, Execute true judgment, and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother;</verse>
				<verse number="10">and don't oppress the widow, nor the fatherless, the sojourner, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But they refused to listen, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yes, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which Yahweh of Hosts had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets: therefore there came great wrath from Yahweh of Hosts.</verse>
				<verse number="13">It is come to pass that, as he cried, and they would not hear, so they shall cry, and I will not hear, said Yahweh of Hosts;</verse>
				<verse number="14">but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">The word of Yahweh of Hosts came [to me], saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Thus says Yahweh: I am returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth; and the mountain of Yahweh of Hosts, The holy mountain.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets of it.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: If it be marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes? says Yahweh of Hosts.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;</verse>
				<verse number="8">and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets who were in the day that the foundation of the house of Yahweh of Hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for animal; neither was there any peace to him who went out or came in, because of the adversary: for I set all men everyone against his neighbor.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in the former days, says Yahweh of Hosts.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For [there shall be] the seed of peace; the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the sky shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.</verse>
				<verse number="13">It shall come to pass that, as you were a curse among the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing. Don't be afraid, [but] let your hands be strong.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For thus says Yahweh of hosts: As I thought to do evil to you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, says Yahweh of Hosts, and I didn't repent;</verse>
				<verse number="15">so again have I thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: don't you fear.</verse>
				<verse number="16">These are the things that you shall do: speak you every man the truth with his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates;</verse>
				<verse number="17">and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, says Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The word of Yahweh of Hosts came to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="19">Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: The fast of the fourth [month], and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love truth and peace.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: [It shall] yet [happen], that there shall come peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities;</verse>
				<verse number="21">and the inhabitants of one [city] shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Yahweh, and to seek Yahweh of Hosts: I will go also.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Yes, many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek Yahweh of Hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: In those days [it shall happen], that ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they shall take hold of the skirt of him who is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">The burden of the word of Yahweh on the land of Hadrach, and Damascus [shall be] its resting-place (for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Yahweh);</verse>
				<verse number="2">and Hamath, also, which borders thereon; Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Tyre did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Behold, the Lord will dispossess her, and he will strike her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also, and shall be sore pained; and Ekron, for her expectation shall be put to shame; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</verse>
				<verse number="6">A bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; and he also shall be a remnant for our God; and he shall be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I will encamp about my house against the army, that none pass through or return; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with my eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion; shout, daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your king comes to you; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on a donkey, even on a colt the foal of a donkey.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace to the nations: and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="11">As for you also, because of the blood of your covenant I have set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Turn you to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope: even today do I declare that I will render double to you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For I have bent Judah for me, I have filled the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up your sons, Zion, against your sons, Greece, and will make you as the sword of a mighty man.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yahweh shall be seen over them; and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Yahweh will blow the trumpet, and will go with whirlwinds of the south.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh of Hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, like the corners of the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yahweh their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people; for [they shall be as] the stones of a crown, lifted on high over his land.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Ask you of Yahweh rain in the time of the latter rain, [even of] Yahweh who makes lightnings; and he will give them showers of rain, to everyone grass in the field.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie; and they have told false dreams, they comfort in vain: therefore they go their way like sheep, they are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.</verse>
				<verse number="3">My anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the male goats; for Yahweh of Hosts has visited his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them as his goodly horse in the battle.</verse>
				<verse number="4">From him shall come forth the corner-stone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They shall be as mighty men, treading down [their enemies] in the mire of the streets in the battle; and they shall fight, because Yahweh is with them; and the riders on horses shall be confounded.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back; for I have mercy on them; and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am Yahweh their God, and I will hear them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">[They of] Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine; yes, their children shall see it, and rejoice; their heart shall be glad in Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them; and they shall increase as they have increased.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I will sow them among the peoples; and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and shall return.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and [place] shall not be found for them.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He will pass through the sea of affliction, and will strike the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt shall depart.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I will strengthen them in Yahweh; and they shall walk up and down in his name, says Yahweh.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Open your doors, Lebanon, that the fire may devour your cedars.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Wail, fir-tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the goodly ones are destroyed: wail, you oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest is come down.</verse>
				<verse number="3">A voice of the wailing of the shepherds! for their glory is destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions! for the pride of the Jordan is laid waste.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Thus said Yahweh my God: Feed the flock of slaughter;</verse>
				<verse number="5">whose possessors kill them, and hold themselves not guilty; and those who sell them say, Blessed be Yahweh, for I am rich; and their own shepherds don't pity them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, says Yahweh; but, behold, I will deliver the men everyone into his neighbor's hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall strike the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So I fed the flock of slaughter, most assuredly the poor of the flock. I took to me two poles; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then I said, I will not feed you: that which dies, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let those who are left eat everyone the flesh of another.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I took my staff Beauty, and cut it apart, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.</verse>
				<verse number="11">It was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that gave heed to me knew that it was the word of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I said to them, If you think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my hire thirty [pieces] of silver.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh said to me, Cast it to the potter, the goodly price that I was prized at by them. I took the thirty [pieces] of silver, and cast them to the potter, in the house of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then I cut apart my other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh said to me, Take to you yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For, behold, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those who are cut off, neither will seek those who are scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the flesh of the fat [sheep], and will tear their hoofs in pieces.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Woe to the worthless shepherd who leaves the flock! the sword shall be on his arm, and on his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">The burden of the word of Yahweh concerning Israel. [Thus] says Yahweh, who stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him:</verse>
				<verse number="2">behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the peoples round about, and on Judah also shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="3">It shall happen in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples; all that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded; and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it.</verse>
				<verse number="4">In that day, says Yahweh, I will strike every horse with terror, and his rider with madness; and I will open my eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The chieftains of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Yahweh of Hosts their God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">In that day will I make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left; and [they of] Jerusalem shall yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Yahweh also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem be not magnified above Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="8">In that day shall Yahweh defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and he who is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of Yahweh before them.</verse>
				<verse number="9">It shall happen in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they shall look to me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one who is in bitterness for his firstborn.</verse>
				<verse number="11">In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;</verse>
				<verse number="13">the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart;</verse>
				<verse number="14">all the families who remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.</verse>

				<verse number="1">In that day there shall be a spring opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.</verse>
				<verse number="2">It shall come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered; and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.</verse>
				<verse number="3">It shall happen that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother who became the father of him shall tell him, You shall not live; for you speak lies in the name of Yahweh; and his father and his mother who became the father of him shall thrust him through when he prophesies.</verse>
				<verse number="4">It shall happen in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed everyone of his vision, when he prophesies; neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:</verse>
				<verse number="5">but he shall say, I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondservant from my youth.</verse>
				<verse number="6">One shall say to him, What are these wounds between your arms? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Awake, sword, against my shepherd, and against the man who is my fellow, says Yahweh of Hosts: strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; and I will turn my hand on the little ones.</verse>
				<verse number="8">It shall happen, that in all the land, says Yahweh, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I will bring the third part into the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, Yahweh is my God.</verse>

			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">Behold, a day of Yahweh comes, when your spoil shall be divided in the midst of you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then shall Yahweh go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.</verse>
				<verse number="4">His feet shall stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives shall be cleft in the midst of it toward the east and toward the west, [and there shall be] a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.</verse>
				<verse number="5">You shall flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azel; yes, you shall flee, like as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah; and Yahweh my God shall come, and all the holy ones with you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">It shall happen in that day, that there shall not be light; the bright ones shall withdraw themselves:</verse>
				<verse number="7">but it shall be one day which is known to Yahweh; not day, and not night; but it shall come to pass, that at evening time there shall be light.</verse>
				<verse number="8">It shall happen in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Yahweh shall be King over all the earth: in that day shall Yahweh be one, and his name one.</verse>
				<verse number="10">All the land shall be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she shall be lifted up, and shall dwell in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king's wine-presses.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Men shall dwell therein, and there shall be no more curse; but Jerusalem shall dwell safely.</verse>
				<verse number="12">This shall be the plague with which Yahweh will strike all the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh shall consume away while they stand on their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their sockets, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="13">It shall happen in that day, that a great tumult from Yahweh shall be among them; and they shall lay hold everyone on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and clothing, in great abundance.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the donkey, and of all the animals that shall be in those camps, as that plague.</verse>
				<verse number="16">It shall happen, that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, Yahweh of Hosts, and to keep the feast of tents.</verse>
				<verse number="17">It shall be, that whoever of [all] the families of the earth doesn't go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Yahweh of Hosts, on them there shall be no rain.</verse>
				<verse number="18">If the family of Egypt doesn't go up, and doesn't come, neither [shall it be] on them; there shall be the plague with which Yahweh will strike the nations that don't go up to keep the feast of tents.</verse>
				<verse number="19">This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that don't go up to keep the feast of tents.</verse>
				<verse number="20">In that day shall there be on the bells of the horses, HOLY TO YAHWEH; and the pots in Yahweh's house shall be like the bowls before the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy to Yahweh of Hosts; and all those who sacrifice shall come and take of them, and boil therein: and in that day there shall be no more a Canaanite in the house of Yahweh of Hosts.</verse>

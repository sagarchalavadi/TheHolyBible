				<verse number="1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,</verse>
				<verse number="2">to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:</verse>
				<verse number="3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,</verse>
				<verse number="5">hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</verse>
				<verse number="6">that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us, in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,</verse>
				<verse number="9">yet for love's sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I beg you for my child, whom I have fathered in my bonds, Onesimus,</verse>
				<verse number="11">who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me;</verse>
				<verse number="12">I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,</verse>
				<verse number="13">whom I wanted to keep with me, that in your behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,</verse>
				<verse number="16">no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, specially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="17">If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,</verse>
				<verse number="24">as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>

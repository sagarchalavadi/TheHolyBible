<book name="2 Timothy">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
				<verse number="2">to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day</verse>
				<verse number="4">longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;</verse>
				<verse number="5">having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For God didn't give us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and discipline.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Don't be ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, his prisoner; but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God,</verse>
				<verse number="9">who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,</verse>
				<verse number="10">but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For this cause I suffer also these things. Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="14">That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit which dwells in us.</verse>
				<verse number="15">This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</verse>
				<verse number="16">May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,</verse>
				<verse number="17">but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me</verse>
				<verse number="18">(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.</verse>
				<verse number="3">You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="4">No soldier on service entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</verse>
				<verse number="5">If also a man competes in the games, he is not crowned, unless he has competed by the rules.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel,</verse>
				<verse number="9">in which I suffer hardship to bonds, as a criminal. But God's word isn't bound.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
				<verse number="11">This saying is faithful: For if we died with him, we will also live with him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we will deny him, he also will deny us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">If we are faithless, he remains faithful -- he can't deny himself.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don't argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in ungodliness,</verse>
				<verse number="17">and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</verse>
				<verse number="18">men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.</verse>
				<verse number="19">However God's firm foundation stands, having this seal, "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness."</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.</verse>
				<verse number="21">If a man therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master's use, prepared for every good work.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,</verse>
				<verse number="25">in gentleness correcting those who oppose him; if perhaps God may give them repentance to the knowledge of the truth,</verse>
				<verse number="26">and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</verse>
				<verse number="3">without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,</verse>
				<verse number="4">traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</verse>
				<verse number="5">holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof. Turn away from these, also.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For of these are those who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,</verse>
				<verse number="7">always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,</verse>
				<verse number="11">persecutions, and sufferings; those things that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; those persecutions that I endured. Out of them all the Lord delivered me.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">From infancy, you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Every scripture inspired by God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness,</verse>
				<verse number="17">that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely to every good work.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">I charge you therefore before God and the Lord, Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom:</verse>
				<verse number="2">preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;</verse>
				<verse number="4">and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.</verse>
				<verse number="8">From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Be diligent to come to me soon,</verse>
				<verse number="10">for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministering.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,</verse>
				<verse number="15">of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.</verse>
				<verse number="16">At my first defense, no one took my part, but all left me. May it not be held against them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me to his heavenly kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The Lord, Jesus Christ, be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
